1.The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a  and b. Add code to print three lines where:
    1.The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
    2.The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
    3.The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    
x = a + b
y = a - b
z = a * b
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


2.Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.
Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.

def is_leap(year):
    leap = False
    
    if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0:
        leap = True
    elif year % 400 == 0 :
        leap = True    
    return leap

year = int(input())
print(is_leap(year))
